# Workday-Calendar

## Description
This code allows users to store hourly events in a daily 9-5 work calendar, while that time-frame is automatically adjusted by color so that users know what time blocks have passed, what time block you are currently in, and what time block is ahead (gray, red, green, resepectively). What day it currently is is also automatically kept track of by way of day.js.
